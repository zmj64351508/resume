## Education
### Electronic and Communication Engineering, Master
Fall 2012 - July 2014  
Donghua University, Shanghai, China

### Communication Engineering, Bachelor
Fall 2008 - July 2012  
Donghua University, Shanghai, China

* Use C in daily coding.
* Familiar with common data structures and algorithms.
* Familiar with Linux dirvier.
* Familiar with ARM architecture.

## Projects

### Protocol Simulation System

The project is a protocol simulation system simulates a tidy protocol similar with modern communication system like GSM. Socket plays the role of physical layer of the protocol while there are also a data link layer for reliable connection and an application layer for bussiness logic.

* Implement the whole protocol by designing state machines.

* Design data structures to make concurrent access in a single thread come true, using "sock" structure to identify connection and linked buffer to store comming messages.

* Trace the protocol message in application layer and write it into a specific file by IMSI which is the identification of a customer.

### ARMUE -- An Emulator for ARM CPUs

ARMUE simulates the instructions, memory, interrupts, peripherals of an ARM based CPU.

* Modular design for all the components of the system so that the system can be easy to be modified and extended.

* Implement the instruction interpretation module for compiled binary file by using a function pointer table and a decode routine.

* Design a common peripheral layer which simulates the real peripherals like I2C, SPI etc. The layer also supplies a set of interfaces compatible with the libraries of STM32 and NXP LPC CPUs.
